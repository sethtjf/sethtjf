Hi, I’m Seth. I'm a lawyer turned engineer.

I co-founded [Blip Labs](https://www.tryblip.com), a bill pay API for banks & fintech companies

I'm looking people who hate paying bills as much as I do and who want to change the way people manage and pay their bills. Come join us. You can reach me at seth [at] tryblip.com
